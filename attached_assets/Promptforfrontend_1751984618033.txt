 Smart Waste Management – Role-Based Interface Differentiation (Functional Frontend with Dummy Data)

Objective:
Update the Smart Waste Management frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to simulate clear, role-based UI and access differences for 4 user types: Household, Business, Operator, and Admin. This will allow stakeholders to see how the app behaves differently depending on who is using it. Use JavaScript and dummy data (no backend) to simulate real interactivity.

Core Roles & Differences:

1. Household (Normal User)
- Profile: name, address, phone, preferred bins (MSW, Recyclables)
- Dashboard shows:
  - Total pickups
  - CO2 saved
  - EcoPoints balance
- Pages visible:
  - My Profile
  - Pickup Requests
  - Pickup History
  - EcoRewards
  - Notifications
- Limited access: cannot see other users or route data

2. Business
- Profile includes business name, contact person, address
- Dashboard shows:
  - Recycling rate (monthly)
  - Pickup volume (kg)
  - Impact report summary
  - Points earned for CSR
- Pages visible:
  - Business Profile
  - Pickup Scheduler
  - Monthly Reports
  - EcoRewards
  - Notifications
- Access to: Monthly sustainability reports and reward history

3. Operator (Waste Management Crew)
- No pickup scheduling or rewards
- Dashboard shows:
  - Today's pickups
  - Route list by district
  - Summary of completed pickups
- Pages visible:
  - Route Dashboard
  - Pickup Table
  - Simulated Map (static or Leaflet.js)
  - Service Log
- Ability to update status: Completed / Missed

4. Admin
- Full dashboard access
- Pages visible:
  - User Overview
  - Pickup Log (all users)
  - Reward System Manager
  - Metrics Dashboard
- Can view and impersonate other roles
- Simulated tools: Add/Edit User, View EcoImpact Graphs by District

Role Switcher (Required)
- Persistent dropdown or segmented control in top nav
- Switch between Household, Business, Operator, Admin
- On switch: update navigation menu, dashboard content, and available pages
- Optionally: display "Viewing as: [Role]" message at the top

Mobile Design (Important)
- All views must be responsive
- On mobile (≤768px), use a hamburger menu to collapse side navigation
- Forms stack vertically
- Dashboard cards use 1-column layout
- Charts are touch-friendly (Chart.js or images)

Data Simulation
- Use local JavaScript objects or arrays to store:
  - User profile data (per role)
  - Pickup history per user
  - Rewards catalog and balance
  - Notifications (array per user type)
  - Routing data for operators

Files Required:
- index.html (landing page, defaults to household)
- household.html
- business.html
- operator.html
- admin.html
- profile.html
- rewards.html
- history.html
- routes.html (for operators)
- style.css
- script.js
- data.js (holds dummy role data)
- assets/ (icons, avatars, sample rewards)

Final Goal:
A working front-end-only simulation of a role-based smart waste platform. Each user type should see a different interface and different features. Stakeholders can switch roles to understand the functional differences and UI experience per role, all powered by dummy data.
