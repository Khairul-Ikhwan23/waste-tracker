Smart Waste Management – User Role System (Frontend Functional with Dummy Data)

Goal:
Create a mobile-optimized frontend module in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a Smart Waste Management web app (SBNone). This module will handle the "user-side" features, including roles, profile management, and settings. No backend is needed, but functionality must work using dummy data (e.g. local JS objects).

Core User Roles (4):
- Household / Normal Users
- Businesses (e.g., shops, restaurants)
- Operators (waste collection companies)
- Admin (oversees users and reports)

General Requirements:
- Responsive layout that works seamlessly on mobile (≤768px) and desktop
- Navigation layout consistent with the existing MVP (sidebar on desktop, collapsible hamburger menu on mobile)
- Include role switcher at the top to simulate different views
- Only English UI for now

Pages / Sections to Implement:

1. Role Switcher Panel (Persistent Header):
- Top navigation bar includes a dropdown or segmented control with options:
  [ Household ] [ Business ] [ Operator ] [ Admin ]
- Switching updates the view (shows relevant data and permissions)
- On mobile, this becomes a dropdown or toggle switch inside the collapsible nav

2. User Profile Page (profile.html)
- Show user profile card with:
  - Profile picture (use static avatar for now)
  - Full name
  - Email
  - Contact number (editable)
  - Address (editable dropdown or text input)
  - Preferred waste types (e.g., recyclables, food, bulky)
  - Bin ownership: "240L MSW", "Recyclables", "Food Waste (pilot)"
- "Edit Profile" button toggles editable fields
- "Save Changes" updates dummy JS object

3. Settings Page (settings.html)
- Allow editing:
  - Notification preference (on/off toggle)
  - Contact number and address (same as profile)
  - Reward opt-in (checkbox or switch)
- All changes reflect in the local user object
- Add a dummy “Delete Account” button (non-functional)

4. Pickup History (pickup-history.html)
- Display table or cards of previous pickups:
  - Date, Waste Type, Status (Completed, Missed)
  - CO₂ saved and volume (kg)
- Filter by waste type or date range

5. EcoRewards Page (rewards.html)
- Show user's EcoPoints balance (e.g., 245 points)
- List of rewards with sample icons/images:
  - 10% discount at EcoMart (100 pts)
  - $5 voucher at Gadong Cafe (150 pts)
- "Redeem" buttons (non-functional for now)
- Leaderboard (optional): Top 5 users by points

6. Notifications Panel
- Notification bell icon in header
- Dropdown list or modal:
  - “Reminder: Pickup scheduled for tomorrow”
  - “New recycling partner in Jerudong”
  - “Waste education event in Kg Ayer this weekend”
- Simulate with dummy data array of notifications

Mobile Optimization Details (Important):
- Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for all layouts
- Sidebar becomes collapsible hamburger menu on mobile
- Use media queries:
  - ≤768px = mobile
  - Show icons and reduce text where needed
- Forms stack vertically on small screens
- Tap targets ≥44px height
- Use native select/date inputs for mobile devices
- Maintain good color contrast for outdoor visibility

Data Management:
- Store user info, pickup history, notifications, and rewards as hardcoded JS objects or arrays
- Role switching changes the data shown using these dummy structures
- No backend, no login system — everything works on the front-end

File Structure:
- index.html (or dashboard.html)
- profile.html
- settings.html
- pickup-history.html
- rewards.html
- style.css
- script.js
- /assets (icons, avatar, reward images)
- data.js (optional for user role simulation)

Final Output:
A complete, front-end only module that visually and functionally represents user-side functionality in a Smart Waste Management system for Brunei. Fully mobile responsive and simulating interactivity with dummy data. Ready to integrate with future backend.
